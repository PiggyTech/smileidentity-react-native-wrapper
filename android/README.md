## Android Setup:
* Navigate to the android subdirectory
* Open the project on Android studio
* Use the instructions on [the Official Androie Guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library#AddDependency) to import the 'aar' Smile Identity Library

Your `settings.gradle` file should automatically include *":smile_library_release"*
Your app's `build.gradle` file should now have a project implementation of *smile_library_release*

Build and run! ðŸ¥³
