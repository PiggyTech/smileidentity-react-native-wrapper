## Android Setup:
* Navigate to the android subdirectory
* Open the project on Android studio
* Follow the instructions on [the Official Guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library#AddDependency) how to import the Smile Identity Library provided by the official website.

Your `settings.gradle` file should automatically include *":smile_library_release"*
